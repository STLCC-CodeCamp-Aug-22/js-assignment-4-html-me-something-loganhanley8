   <h2 id="B1">The Start</h2>
   <body>
    At the very beginning, I was around 150 lbs my freshman through junior years of highschool.
    I was very small and I would say I had a slight skinny fat build heading into my junior year. 
    Outside of school I played sports with my buddies and was very active but my diet was atrocious.
    It was around my sophmore year where I noticed muscle, fat, and the athleticism of others.

   <h2 id="B2">Depression and Obsession</h2>
   <body>
   At this point roughly towards the end of my first semester of high school. I realized I was pushing towards 
   186 lbs. This is the highest recorded weight to this point of my life and the worst body fat to muslce ratio
   I have ever noticed. Not only did I notice but so did others. I had never struggled with my weight but getting a job
   and eating out all the time had finally taken its toll. I decided enough was enough and right after covid-19, I finally
   made a change in march of 2020.

   <h2 id="B3">My First Routine</h2>
   <body>
   I started my journey towards losing weight and it was very successful and by the time of graduation I was
   169 lbs which happened to be my lowest weight since my junior year. I ran 6 miles every day, 3 miles to my bestfriends house
   and 3 miles back. Also with landscaping and a caloric deficit i was fitting clothes better and feeling much better.

   <h2 id="B4">College Demotivation</h2>
   <body>
   As all good things appear they will come to an end, at least that's how I felt when college started and my weight
   went up as I lifted less and less until my weight was back up to 181. I was shattered, felt defeated, and almsot felt 
   into a downward spiral as I believed the weight was destined to always increase. College had begun and my weight
   increased, I was doing excellent in my classes but did not have as much time as I did to diet and be as active.
   Although things felt rough and desperate times were reached, I pulled myself out of slump and had an action plan.
