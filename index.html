   <head>My Weight Lifting Journey</head>
   <h2>The Start</h2>
   <body>
    At the very beginning, I was around 150 lbs my freshman through junior years of highschool.
    I was very small and I would say I had a slight skinny fat build heading into my junior year. 
    Outside of school I played sports with my buddies and was very active but my diet was atrocious.
    It was around my sophmore year where I noticed muscle, fat, and the athleticism of others.

   <h2>Depression and Obsession</h2>
   <body>
   At this point roughly towards the end of my first semester of high school. I realized I was pushing towards 
   186 lbs. This is the highest recorded weight to this point of my life and the worst body fat to muslce ratio
   I have ever noticed. Not only did I notice but so did others. I had never struggled with my weight but getting a job
   and eating out all the time had finally taken its toll. I decided enough was enough and right after covid-19, I finally
   made a change in march of 2020.

   <h2>My First Routine</h2>
   <body>
   I started my journey towards losing weight and it was very successful and by the time of graduation I was
   169 lbs which happened to be my lowest weight since my junior year. I ran 6 miles every day, 3 miles to my bestfriends house
   and 3 miles back. Also with landscaping and a caloric deficit i was fitting clothes better and feeling much better.
